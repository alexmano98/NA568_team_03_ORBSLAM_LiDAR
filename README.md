NA 568 WN 23 Team 03 Final Project

How to compile:

In CMakeLists.txt:
	change lines 4 and 5 to wherever you have ORB_SLAM3 and litamin installed
	Change line 7 to wherever the CMakeLists.txt for ORBSLAM3 is
	Modify executable to what you want TODO for later once we have code set up

In CMakeLists.txt in ORB_SLAM3:
	Replace with CMakeLists_ORB_SLAM3.txt in repository
	Change lines 132 and 133 to match wherever those files are stored on your computer
	NOTE: This will not allow you to compile ORBSLAM3 outside of our project folder, so make sure to save the original CMakeLists.txt in ORB_SLAM3
